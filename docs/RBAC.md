# Introduction

> Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network. Employees are only allowed to access the information necessary to effectively perform their job duties. Access can be based on several factors, such as authority, responsibility, and job competency. In addition, access to computer resources can be limited to specific tasks such as the ability to view, create, or modify a file. As a result, lower-level employees usually do not have access to sensitive data if they do not need it to fulfill their responsibilities. This is especially helpful if you have many employees and use third-parties and contractors that make it difficult to closely monitor network access. Using RBAC will help in securing your companyâ€™s sensitive data and important applications.

# Description

If my account is role manager and my account does not have access to see or create groups, I want to add them, and my account string permission is "group:read;group:create".

If my account is a manager and the manager role has a manage category, the code for manage category is category. If I want to limit access to delete categories for my account, I can add "group:read;group:create;category:delete:deny" to my account string permission.

Check role permissions in api deletion category is passed if role account equals "superadmin" or (role account equals "manager" | "admin" or permission account has "category:delete") and my account string permission does not have "category:delete:deny".
-> role == "superadmin" | (((role == "admin) || (role == "manager) || permission.contains("category:delete")) &&!permission.contains("category:delete:deny"))
